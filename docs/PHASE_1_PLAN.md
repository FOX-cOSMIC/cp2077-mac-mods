# Phase 1 Implementation Plan — v1.0 TweakXL Foundation

**Status:** DRAFT (pending T-002e completion)
**Owner:** Conductor → distributed to Hookline / Schema / Patchwork

This document is the handoff from Phase 0 (research) to Phase 1 (engineering). It defines the actual code to write, who writes what, dependencies between pieces, and the order things should land.

It is built on the Phase 0 facts (F-001..F-017, FA-001..FA-011). If a Phase 1 task seems to contradict a Phase 0 fact, **stop** — the plan is wrong, not the facts.

---

## What Phase 0 Settled

These are the load-bearing FACTS that the implementation plan rests on. Any change to these invalidates parts of the plan.

| FACT | Summary | Where it affects Phase 1 |
|------|---------|--------------------------|
| F-001 / F-003 | Stock 2.3.1 binary accepts `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` without re-sign | Distribution: no re-sign step in installer for v1.0 |
| F-004 / F-007 | `runtime = static + slide`; slide varies per launch | Every runtime address computation in our code |
| F-011 | Global `TweakDB*` at `0x1080c92d0` in `__bss`; getter `FUN_102b73c7c`; initializer `FUN_102b73b50`; constructor `FUN_102b73db8` | Singleton-access primitive in red4ext-mac |
| F-013 | TweakDB struct = 0x168 bytes; records are plain hash table (not fn-ptr dispatch) | Applicator design — direct memory writes |
| F-015 | Full struct field map: 3 hash maps at +0x58/+0x88/+0x108, value buffer at +0x148, etc. | TweakDB accessor primitives in red4ext-mac |
| F-016 | TweakDB has NO vtable | Rules out vtable-hook approach; nothing to install in vtable |
| F-017 | Flats use plain hash table + value buffer (NOT fn-ptr dispatch). H-001 disproved. | Applicator: walks hash map, writes value buffer — no code hooks |
| FA-001 | `__TEXT` is immutable under code signing | No inline patching anywhere |
| FA-002 | No offline patching | Runtime hooking only (D-001) |
| D-005 | Reuse psiberx `.tweak` parser via `TWEAKXL_MAC_OFFLINE` | Patchwork doesn't write a `.tweak` parser from scratch |

**One unknown remaining (T-002e):**
- Which hash map (`+0x58` or `+0x108`) is flats vs queries
- The apply-mods trigger point (H-007)

The implementation can largely proceed assuming the Windows-analogy answer (`+0x58` = flats), with T-002e providing confirmation before mutation code is enabled.

---

## v1.0 Component Breakdown

For v1.0, we ship a single dylib (`libtweakxl-mac.dylib`) that contains both the runtime primitives and the mod-loader. The framework / plugin split (`red4ext-mac` ≠ `tweakxl-mac`) is preserved in source structure for v1.x but is one binary at runtime.

## Task Assignments

### 🪝 Hookline (cp2077-hook-engineer) — Runtime Primitives

**P1.1 — Slide capture primitive** (1-2 hours of agent time)
- File: `src/red4ext-mac/src/loader/Loader.cpp`, `src/red4ext-mac/src/runtime/Symbols.cpp`
- Behavior:
  - `__attribute__((constructor))` fires at dylib load
  - Registers `_dyld_register_func_for_add_image` to detect Cyberpunk2077 main image load
  - On detection, computes and stores image base + slide
  - Exposes accessor: `IntPtr GetSlide()` and `IntPtr GetImageBase()`
- Largely reusable from `src/red4ext-mac/src/probes/h001_probe.cpp` (Hookline's own existing code)
- Acceptance: a unit test that injects the dylib, prints base + slide, exits

**P1.2 — Singleton-access primitive** (30 min)
- File: `src/red4ext-mac/src/runtime/SingletonAccess.cpp`
- Behavior:
  - `TweakDB* GetTweakDB()` → returns `*(0x1080c92d0 + slide)` if non-null, else nullptr
  - Safe: uses `mach_vm_read_overwrite` to never crash if pointer is invalid
- Acceptance: when the dylib is injected at game launch, polling returns null until populate completes, then returns the live pointer

**P1.3 — Apply-trigger via singleton polling** (2-3 hours)
- File: `src/red4ext-mac/src/runtime/ApplyTrigger.cpp`
- **Mechanism: poll the singleton.** Per F-018, the apply-trigger is `FUN_102b75744` @ static `0x102b75744` (TweakDB initial-load orchestrator). Single caller at `0x10a42f7de`. Loads `tweakdb.bin`, parses, populates. On return: singleton fully populated.
- **Why polling (not a code hook):**
  - No vtable (F-016) → can't VTable-hook
  - No fn-ptr dispatch (F-017) → can't fn-ptr-table-hook
  - Direct `bl` intra-image calls → GOT doesn't apply
  - `__TEXT` immutable (FA-001) → can't inline-patch the `bl`
  - Polling is FA-001-compliant and adequate (the orchestrator runs once at init)
- Behavior:
  - Spawn a background thread or use `dispatch_async` after dylib init
  - Loop: read `*(0x1080c92d0 + slide)` every ~50ms
  - When singleton is non-null AND the records map count (TweakDB+0x90) is non-zero AND some N consecutive polls return the same count → DB is populated and stable
  - Fire registered callbacks once
  - Exit polling loop
- Optional optimization: instead of timer-based polling, watch the `records.count` field at TweakDB+0x90 — when it transitions from 0 to non-zero AND stops changing, DB is ready
- Alternative (future, NOT v1.0): hook `TweakDBReloader` for re-entrant/hot-reload support. Uninvestigated, flagged by Scope as low-priority follow-up.
- Acceptance: a registered callback fires exactly once per game session, after `*(0x1080c92d0 + slide)` is populated, before any gameplay reads it

### 🗄️ Schema (cp2077-tweakdb-engineer) — TweakDB Accessor Primitives

**P1.4 — TweakDB struct accessor** (2-3 hours)
- File: `src/red4ext-mac/src/runtime/TweakDB.cpp`
- Behavior:
  - Wraps the raw `TweakDB*` from P1.2 with typed accessors
  - All offsets per F-015: hash maps at +0x58/+0x88/+0x108, value buffer at +0x148
  - Methods: `GetRecordsMap()`, `GetFlatsMap()`, `GetQueriesMap()`, `GetValueBuffer()`, `GetValueBufferSize()`, `GetValueBufferCapacity()`
- No mutation methods at this layer — mutation happens in the applicator
- **H-008 verification (folded in):** at first successful access after DB-populate, log both +0x58 and +0x108 hash map counts. Per H-008, flats should massively outnumber queries (typically thousands vs tens). The map with the bigger count is flats; if +0x58 wins → H-008 → resolved-fact; if +0x108 wins → H-008 → resolved-failed (and the offsets in this accessor must swap). This must happen before P1.10 enables any flat-write code.
- Acceptance: dump the running TweakDB's records map count and value buffer size; verify both are non-zero after game's TweakDB load; H-008 resolved with a printed F-NNN-style log line

**P1.5 — Hash map walker** (2 hours)
- File: `src/red4ext-mac/src/runtime/HashMap.cpp`
- Behavior:
  - Given a hash map base and a TweakDBID, walks the bucket-index array to find the entry
  - FNV-1a hashing (per F-012)
  - Returns pointer to the entry, or nullptr if not found
- Acceptance: look up a known TweakDBID (e.g., `Items.Preset_Ajax_Default`) in the records map; assert the found entry's hash matches

**P1.6 — Value buffer reader/writer** (1-2 hours)
- File: `src/red4ext-mac/src/runtime/TweakDB.cpp` (extends P1.4)
- Behavior:
  - Read/write typed values at offsets within the value buffer at +0x148
  - Type-tag handling per the Windows TweakDB type system (22 types per `docs/reference/tweakdb-binary-format.md`)
- Acceptance: read a known flat value (e.g., `Player.maxHealth`); modify it; verify the game observes the new value

### 🧩 Patchwork (cp2077-mod-loader) — Parsers + Applicator

**P1.7 — Mod scanner** (1 hour)
- File: `src/tweakxl-mac/src/loader/ModScanner.cpp`
- Behavior:
  - Recursively walks `r6/tweaks/` for `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.tweak` files
  - Sort tier: `_#$!` first, `^` last, others middle (matches Windows behavior per `windows-tweakxl-api.md`)
  - Dispatches each file to the right parser

**P1.8 — YAML parser** (3-4 hours)
- File: `src/tweakxl-mac/src/parsers/YAML.cpp`
- Behavior:
  - yaml-cpp dep
  - Top-level mapping → entries (flat assignments + record blocks)
  - Eight `$`-attributes: `$type`, `$value`, `$base`, `$props`, `$game`, `$dlc`, `$instances`
  - Nine array mutation tags: `!append`, `!append-once`, `!append-from`, `!prepend`, `!prepend-once`, `!prepend-from`, `!merge`, `!remove`, `!remove-all`
  - Output: op AST (`model/Operation.hpp`)
- Acceptance: parse `reference/example-mods/` YAML samples; produce expected op AST

**P1.9 — `.tweak` parser via psiberx (D-005)** (1 hour)
- File: `src/tweakxl-mac/src/parsers/Tweak.cpp`
- Behavior:
  - `#define TWEAKXL_MAC_OFFLINE` in build
  - Include `reference/windows-tweakxl/src/Red/TweakDB/Source/Parser.hpp` etc.
  - Adapt psiberx's `TweakSource` output → our `Operation` AST
- Acceptance: parse a `.tweak` file from `reference/example-mods/`; produce equivalent op AST as Windows

**P1.10 — Applicator** (3-4 hours)
- File: `src/tweakxl-mac/src/applicator/Applicator.cpp`
- Behavior:
  - Takes op AST + `TweakDB*` (from Schema's primitives)
  - For each op:
    - Compute TweakDBID hash
    - Walk appropriate hash map
    - For Assign on flat: write to value buffer at the entry's offset
    - For Append/Remove on array flat: realloc + memmove the array within the buffer
    - For record cloning: replicate entry into records map with new ID
  - Atomic per-mod: all-or-nothing
- Acceptance: apply a real Nexus mod from `reference/example-mods/`; verify the in-game stat change matches Windows behavior

**P1.11 — Plugin orchestrator** (1 hour)
- File: `src/tweakxl-mac/src/plugin/Plugin.cpp`
- Behavior:
  - Registers apply-trigger callback (uses P1.3)
  - On trigger: gets singleton (P1.2), scans mods (P1.7), parses (P1.8 + P1.9), applies (P1.10)
  - Logs results

### 🔍 Sieve (cp2077-reviewer)

```

**Parallelism opportunities:**
- P1.1 (Hookline) + P1.7/P1.8/P1.9 (Patchwork) can land in parallel — different agents, different files
- P1.4/P1.5/P1.6 (Schema) can land after P1.2 but before P1.10

**Critical path:** P1.1 → P1.2 → P1.4 → P1.6 → P1.10 → P1.11

## What Done Looks Like (v1.0 Acceptance)

- [ ] 5+ real Nexus TweakXL mods load and apply unchanged
- [ ] In-game stat changes match Windows TweakXL behavior
- [ ] No crashes during 1-hour play session
- [ ] User can install with: drop dylib in known location + edit env var (no re-sign required for stock 2.3.1)
- [ ] `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` exists and works for someone who isn't Lucas

---

## What Phase 1 Explicitly Excludes

| Excluded | Where it lands |
|----------|---------------|
| ArchiveXL parity (custom assets) | v1.x |
| CET (Lua scripting + ImGui-on-Metal) | v2.0 |
| Codeware / redscript runtime | v2.0 |
| Plugin SDK for third-party dylibs | v1.x |
| MAP_JIT trampolines / inline hooks | v1.x or v2.0 |
| Mod manager UI | Never (CLI tooling only for now) |

---

## Open Questions Before Sprint 1 Starts

1. **T-002e outcome** — flats are at +0x58 or +0x108? Apply-trigger function address?
2. **Build system** — CMake config for the `TWEAKXL_MAC_OFFLINE` flag + psiberx include path needs first iteration
3. **Test harness** — Crashlog needs a reproducible "load this mod, observe this in-game" runbook

These do not block Sprint 1's primitives (P1.1, P1.2). They block P1.10's applicator.

---

## Living Document

This plan will be updated after T-002e lands. Expected revisions:
- Concrete address for apply-trigger in P1.3
- Confirmation of which hash map is flats (or revised offsets if Scope finds something unexpected)
- Maybe a couple of new gotchas discovered along the way
